# IBM Data Science Capstone
This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Science course.

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyze SpaceX launch data to predict the likelihood of Falcon 9 first-stage landing successfully. The analysis involves data collection, processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling.

## Contents
- **Data Collection**: API calls, web scraping
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and feature engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing trends
- **Predictive Modeling**: Classification models for success prediction

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/puru999/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone.git

2. Install required dependencies:
3. Open and run Jupyter Notebooks.
